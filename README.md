# Initial Setup 
- To get this to run, you require your email to be part of the test users for this project on Google Cloud
- Please reach out to me through either `da.shiv.patel@gmail.com` or `shiv.patel` on Slack with your email and I can add it

- Then, you can run the code using:
```
npm install
node index.js
```
- This will create a file called `token.json`
- You can use `index.js` to get data and process it from your Google Drive
